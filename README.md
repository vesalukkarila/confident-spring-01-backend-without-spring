Learning to create a simple web application without Spring

## Learning goals
For what need Spring is created.
Basics of servlets and Tomcat.
Basics of backend.

## Sources
Based largely on learnings from Marco Behler's course which I bought for 100â‚¬. 
After going through the course twice trying out my own variation and understanding better how things work.
